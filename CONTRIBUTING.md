<!--

It is appreciated if you follow a similar style to the pico-sdk from Raspberry Pi:

- 4 spaces indents
- `function() {` with the brace on the same line
- `//` comments everywhere
- https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html for the rest

However this is not a hard requirement.
